                        Digital marketing provides ways for companies to grow their audience, increase profits, and build a better relationship with past and future customers. While that’s the goal of traditional marketing campaigns too, digital marketing allows brands to target a more specific or niche audience and is easier to measure results.

                        Search Engine Optimization, commonly referred to as SEO, is the act of improving content and webpages in order to rank higher on search engine results pages. Search engines have algorithms that determine which webpages hold the most relevant results, and those pages are ranked highest among the search results.
                        <br><br>
                        Using SEO tactics, such as keywords, meta descriptions, and links, your content will stand out to search engine algorithms as relevant information and ultimately rank higher.

                        On-page SEO is anything that you do on your own website – content, back-end optimization, meta tags, etc. Off-page SEO is less controllable. Off-page SEO is what happens off of your website that relates directly back to it. This may include domain authority, backlinks, and more.

                        Social media platforms allow users to connect and engage with one another through shared content. These websites were originally developed for social networking, but since then, social media has become a popular marketing approach. Businesses often use social media to showcase products and services, connect with current or potential customers, and boost brand awareness.

                        This is strongly dependent on your brand and where else you’re marketing. One thing that we will say, though, is brands often underestimate how long it takes to create a successful social media marketing campaign. Our team puts multiple hours in per week to create graphics, write content, engage with other brands, and stay on top of the most recent trends.

                        While social media presence is crucial for all companies, each company will have different social media needs and strategies. For some, Facebook will be the best platform for business, while Instagram may be better for others. To determine which platform is best for your business, it is important to first determine your target audience and social media goals.

                        Nowadays, users are using a variety of different devices of all different sizes and orientations. As a result, companies should be establishing a responsive web design when building web pages. Responsive design has the ability to detect the user’s screen size and orientation in order to adjust the content and layout accordingly. For example, the layout on a mobile device will be much narrower than the layout on a desktop.

                        Every small business is different, and every website will be different. Creating a new website can be a daunting task, but PDD is here to make it easy. Every website should have the basics: Homepage, About, Contact page, Products/ Services, FAQs, and Testimonials.
                        Besides the basics, every business should include additional web pages that are unique and relevant. Every small business is different, which means every website is different.

                        Websites should be designed to invite and entertain users, not push them away. The only way to attract and maintain users is with a good web design. The homepage should be visually appealing, easy to understand, and clear of any annoying pop-ups.
                        If the homepage is bad, the user will exit the website rather than continue exploring. The web design should also allow for easy navigation and fast load speed without blurry images or extensive copy.

                        The primary way a website increases sales is by offering users a convenient way to shop for products and services. Through the use of pop-ups offers and special online discounts, small businesses can encourage consumers to make the switch from window-shopping to buying.
                        With an enhanced incentive to buy, along with clear and concise product descriptions, users are quickly turning to company websites for all their consumer needs.

                        Social media falls in the brand awareness and consideration stage of the sales funnel. Social media platforms allow businesses to connect with their target audience and slowly but surely nudge them down the funnel with content and links to learn more.
                        By providing relevant information about products and services, engaging with their audience, and providing free trials or specials, businesses are able to nurture leads into buyers.

                        As a general rule of thumb, companies should be publishing new blogs at least twice a month – blogs are key to keeping your website updated with the relevant and fresh information that search engines prefer.
                        If any significant news or information has been released, that content should be posted as soon as possible. Pillar pages and landing pages content should be regularly revised as the company grows and changes.

                        As compared to standard SEO, local SEO refers to Local Search Engine Optimization. Local SEO comes into play when users are searching for products, services, or resources near them in real-time.
                        For example, a search for “shoes” will yield greatly different results than a search for “shoes near me.” Local search often includes locations, which is why companies should keep their Google My Business profile up to date.

                        When it comes to search engine optimization (SEO), there’s an extremely wide range of strategies to use. Some are simple, yet impactful, and don’t take very long. Others are incredibly intensive and may take days or even weeks to fully implement. Just like many other services, SEO costs all depend on how experienced your SEO agency is and how intensive you want your optimization to be.
